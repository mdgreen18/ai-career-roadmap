# 🧠 AI Developer Learning Tracker
**Goal: Be job-ready for a tech role in development/AI by mid-August to September**  
**Study time:** Weeknights after 9 PM | Saturday check-ins with ChatGPT

---

## ✅ Week 1: July 7–13 – *Python Practice & Setup*

- [x] Set up your GitHub account (if not already)
- [x] Complete 3–4 hours of Python on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)
- [x] Install Python locally and write a basic script (e.g., calculator or to-do CLI)
- [x] Solve 2 easy LeetCode Python problems
- [x] Optional: Push your script to GitHub

**Notes:**  
- Focus on understanding variables, loops, functions, and error handling.  
- Ask for help if stuck—don’t waste more than 30 minutes on a single issue.

## 📅 Week 2 Plan: July 14–20 – _Python Libraries + Project Time_

### 🎯 Goals:

|Topic|Task|
|---|---|
|**Python Libraries**|Learn NumPy, Pandas, and matplotlib basics|
|**Mini Project**|Start a simple data analysis or scraping project|
|**LeetCode**|Solve 2 more easy Python challenges|
|**Git Practice**|Commit/push your new code with good messages|

### ✅ Tasks:

-  Work through Kaggle: Python (focus on Pandas/NumPy chapters)

-  Build a new mini project:

  - Suggested: **CSV Budget Tracker** – Read CSV, calculate totals, visualize spending

-  Push your new project to GitHub

-  Link it in your `ai-career-roadmap` repo

-  Solve 2 easy problems on LeetCode

---
# 🧠 AI Career Coaching – Week 3 Plan (July 21–27)

**Theme:** Intermediate Python + Git Practice with Real Use

---

## ✅ Week 2 Summary (Reflection)

### ✔️ Wins:
- Web scraper polished and pushed to GitHub
- Studied consistently
- Commit history is clear and readable
- Honest reflections on motivation and workflow

### ❌ Incomplete / To Revisit:
- Budget Tracker not finished
- No Git branching or PRs yet
- Didn't finish Kaggle library modules (NumPy/Pandas/matplotlib)
- No file handling or exception exercises

---

## 🚧 Primary Goals for Week 3

### 🗂️ Project: **Log Analyzer CLI App**
**Purpose:** Practice file I/O, error handling, and Git branching with a mini tool

#### 🎯 Features:
- Read from a `.log` or `.txt` file
- Return:
  - Total lines processed
  - Count of lines with "ERROR"
  - Most common error message
- Export summary to a new file (`.txt` or `.json`)

#### 🧪 Skills:
- `open()`, `.readlines()`, string parsing
- `try/except` logic
- CLI formatting
- Git: Create a `summary-feature` branch and merge with PR
- Bonus: Add timestamps, export formats

---

## 🧪 Python Practice Challenges (Pick 2–3)

1. **Email Parser**
   - Read `.txt` of email addresses
   - Validate format
   - Save valid and invalid emails to separate files

2. **Config File Checker**
   - Read a `.json` config file
   - If a key is missing (e.g., `"timeout"`), add it with a default value
   - Save the updated config

3. **Simple Exception Decorator**
   - Write a decorator that catches/logs exceptions of any wrapped function

---

## 📊 Kaggle Modules (1 every 2 days)
- [x] **NumPy** – Monday
- [ ] **Pandas** – Wednesday
- [ ] **Matplotlib** – Friday  
👉 *[Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)*

---

## 🧰 Git Practice
- Create `summary-feature` branch
- Commit 2–3 times
- Open a pull request and merge it into `main`
- Optional: Try reviewing your own PR for practice

---

## 🧠 Learning Habits
- Create a “📓 What I Learned” journal in this vault
- Each night, write 1–2 bullets of:
  - 🛠 What I built/practiced
  - 🧠 What I learned or struggled with

---

## ✅ Weekly Checklist

- [ ] Create Log Analyzer CLI project
- [ ] Use Git branch + PR workflow
- [ ] Complete Kaggle: NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib
- [x] Complete 2–3 Python file/exception challenges
- [ ] Write nightly “What I Learned” notes
- [ ] Weekly check-in (Sat/Sun)

---
## 🔄 Week 3 "Reboot" Plan (Aug 10–16)

Shrinking the scope to get moving again while still hitting the key skills.

### 🎯 1. Finish **Log Analyzer CLI App** (Main Project)

- **Day 1–2**:
    - Create repo folder & set up `.gitignore` before coding.
    - Implement reading `.log` / `.txt` file & counting total lines.
        
- **Day 3**:
    - Add `"ERROR"` counting & most common error.
    - Export summary to `.txt` or `.json`.
    
- **Day 4**:
    - Create a `summary-feature` branch, make 2–3 commits, open PR, and merge.
        

---

### 🧪 2. Python Challenge — _Simple Exception Decorator_

- **Goal**: Write a decorator that catches/logs exceptions for any wrapped function.
- Keep it short — 15–30 mins is fine.
- Example add-on: Have it write errors to a `errors.log` file.
    

---

### 📊 3. Kaggle Catch-Up

- **Aug 12** – Pandas module
- **Aug 14** – Matplotlib module
    

---

### 📓 4. Learning Journal Restart

- 1 bullet for “What I built” + 1 bullet for “What I learned” each night.
- Even if you do only 10 minutes of coding, log it.
    

---

## ✅ End-of-Week Deliverables

By Sunday night (Aug 16):

- Working Log Analyzer CLI app pushed to GitHub
- One branch → PR → merge workflow completed
- Pandas + Matplotlib modules finished
- Exception decorator challenge complete
- 5 journal entries

---

### 📆 Week 4 (Aug 19–25) Suggested Plan

Let’s call this one **“Polish + Data Skills Catch-Up”** since you got the project foundation down.

#### 🎯 1. Kaggle Catch-Up

- **Day 1–2:** Finish Pandas module
- **Day 3–4:** Finish Matplotlib module
- End of week: Do 1 mini exercise (like plotting error counts from your Log Analyzer) with Pandas/Matplotlib.

#### 🧪 2. Mini Challenge
- Add a **command-line flag** to your Log Analyzer (e.g. `--export=json` vs `--export=txt`).
- Keeps the project alive but light-touch.
    

#### 📓 3. Learning Journal (Restart Lite)
- Instead of nightly, do **3 entries this week** (Mon/Wed/Fri).
- Format:
    - 🛠️ What I built/practiced
    - 📚 What I learned
#### ✅ End-of-Week Deliverables (Aug 25)

- Pandas + Matplotlib modules completed
- Log Analyzer supports `--export` option
- 3 journal entries

---

## 📌 Notes
- ✅ Prefer HackerRank over LeetCode
- ⚠️ Watch out for `.gitignore` issues on Windows – commit from outside venv
- ⏳ Budget Tracker can be continued later if needed
